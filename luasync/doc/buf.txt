Buffer interface
----------------
A.K.A "There's no object refcounting in Lua? It's been done before."

Firstly, few notes.

Every argument where buffer is expected can be any lua_tostring-able value,
including numbers, strings etc, everything lua_tostring-able (ie has a __tostring).
Before that, buf library tries to lookup __tobuf metamethod and expects buffer
structure returned. If everything of the above has failed, we raise an error.

Buffers are userdata, thus they're REFERENCEd when assigning them to variables.
That means
a = b
a and b refer to the very same buffer. some operations over buffer modify the original
buffer argument (cut, insert, append, prepend) and return number of bytes
actually operated upon, or nil if the operation failed (invalid index ..)

Other functions like (new, sub, dup, concat) return NEW buffer and the arguments remain
untouched. Why do you ask? Because creating unique copy only for these functions actually make
sense. It also forces the programmer to work with as less of copies of buffers as possible.
Note that all buffer operations are zero-copy (refcounted), but even buffer head
describing buffer itself (userdata) take some space and overhead to create/manage.

* These functions CREATE and RETURN a NEW buffer:
buf.new();
	this will create new empty buffer

buf.sub(buf, start, len);
	returns given part of the buffer. original buffer unmodified,
	unique copy is returned.

buf.dup(buf)
	create exact duplicate of given buffer, but living it's own life.
	same as buf.sub(buf, 0, #buf);

buf.concat(buf1,buf2,buf3,bufX...)
	concenate several buffers into one. zero arguments return empty buffer.
	this returns unique NEW buffer, leaving it's arguments untouched.
	This functions is also the '..' metamethod thus equals to:
	new = buf1 .. buf2 .. buf3 .. bufX

* These functions MODIFY the buffer and return number of bytes modified
  or nil in case of error:
  
buf.cut(buf, start, len)
	cut off part of buffer the buffer starting at start of length len.
	and return the cutted part as new buffer.

buf.rm(buf, start, len)
	dispose part of the buffer

buf.insert(buf, offset, what)
	insert buffer 'what' at position offset of buffer 'buf'
	

buf.append(buf, buf1, buf2, bufX)
	append buf1, buf2, .. bufX to the first buffer, that is:
	buf.append(x, "b", "c", "d") x = "bcd".

buf.prepend(buf, buf1, buf2, bufX...)
	prepend buf1, buf2, .. bufX in front of the first buffer, that is:
	buf.prepend(x, "b", "c", "d") x = "dcb", yah basically
	reversed order.

* Read-only operations:
buf.find(haystack, needle, [start[,len]])
	find 'needle' in 'haystack' and return offset at which 'haystack' occurs.
	do NOT use "if (not buf.find...)" because 0 is also valid offset, instead,
	use if (buf.find(..) == nil)

buf.cmp(buf1, buf2)
	check if raw contents of the buffers are same.
	returns boolean.

	You should avoid the == operator which is quite special and returns
	true bascially only for buffers which are clone's from dup()
	which undergone the same order of operations (that is, only
	buffer's internal representation is compared, not the actual
	data):

	example:
	b1 = new("blabla")
	b2 = b1:dup()
	b1:cut(1,1)
	b2:cut(1,1)
	if (b1 == b2) => true

	b1 = new("blabla")
	b2 = b1:dup()
	b1:cut(1,1)
	b1:insert(1,"l")
	if (b1 == b2) => false
	b1:cmp(b2) => true

	To understand exactly how it works, look up the source code.
	Otherwise parental supervision is requiered before using ==.

* Use of the following two is discouraged. They're slow and generally does not exactly
  fall into what were buffers designed for. If you want string operations, convert
  buffers to strings using tostring().

buf.peek(buf, pos)
	Return a byte of buffer at given pos.

buf.poke(buf, pos, val)
	Set a byte at pos to value 'val'. val can be either number
	or a one-byte string.
